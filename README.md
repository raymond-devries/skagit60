# skagit60

This is a deployed django site at [skagit60.com](skagit60.com). The pupose of this site is to track and share the progress the [Skagit Alpine Club](skagitalpinelcub.com) climbing 60 selected peaks. It uses django and django-rest for the backend and templates with vue sprinkled in for the front end. Gunicorn is used for the WSGI server. This sits in front of Nginx that acts as a reverse proxy and serves static files. This is all deployed in docker contatiners that are hosted on an AWS lightsail server.

Feel free to check out the code, provide any suggestions or submit a pull request.

Thanks for checking out my project.
